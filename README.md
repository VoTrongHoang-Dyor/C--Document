## 📚 What's Inside?

This notebook contains a vast amount of knowledge synthesized from academic textbooks and practical tutorial series:

### 1. Core C# Language
* **Fundamentals:** Program structure, Variables & Constants, Data Types (Value type vs. Reference type), Operators, and Console I/O.
* **Control Flow:** Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), Branching logic, and String manipulation (`String` vs. `StringBuilder`).
* **Method Techniques:** Defining Methods, `ref` and `out` parameters, and Extension Methods.
* **Collections:** Arrays (1D, 2D), Lists, Dictionaries, and Generics vs. Non-Generic Collections.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Concepts:** Classes, Objects, Structs, and Enums.
* **The 4 Pillars:** Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction (Abstract Classes and Interfaces).
* **Class Components:** Constructors, Destructors, Properties, and Nullable types.

### 3. Advanced C# & Modern Techniques
* **Event & Delegate Handling:** Understanding **Delegates**, **Action**, **Func**, Anonymous methods, and Lambda expressions.
* **Data Querying:** Mastering **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query) for powerful data manipulation.
* **Software Architecture:** **Dependency Injection (DI)**, ServiceCollection, and Inversion of Control (IoC).
* **Utilities:** Exception Handling (Try-Catch-Finally), Attributes, and creating/publishing libraries to **NuGet**.

### 4. Web Development with ASP.NET Core (.NET 5/6+)
Includes detailed guides for building real-world Websites from A-Z:
* **Patterns:** Deep dive into **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) and **Razor Pages**.
* **Razor Syntax:** Razor syntax rules, TagHelpers, HtmlHelpers, Layouts, Partial Views, and ViewComponents.
* **Identity & Security:**
    * Integrating **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
    * Registration, Login, Role Management (Authorization).
    * Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Social Login (**Google, Facebook**).
* **Real-world Projects:**
    * Building a Blog/News website.
    * Product & Category Management systems.
    * Integrating Admin Dashboards (SB Admin) and FontAwesome.

### 5. Networking & System
* Basic network programming and using `HttpListener` to create simple Web Servers.
